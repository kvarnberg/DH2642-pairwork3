This is your repository for week2.

To continue from one of your week1 codebases (choose whichever):

```
git remote add week2 replace-with-the-ssh-git-link-to-this-repository
git pull week2 master --allow-unrelated-histories --no-edit
git push -u week2 master
```

Now you will by default be pushing here instead of your week1 repository, but you could still push to it with "git push origin". 

Of course, you can also just clone this repository and copy the files over.
